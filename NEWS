Version 0.1.1 (2013-xx-xx)
  * Minor fixes/improvements to build/tests.
  * Fix crash when null error pointer passed to src_create (lsr bindings only).
  * Fix resampling not working in many cases when anti_aliasing_pc != 100.
  * Allow stopband to begin below nyquist.
  * For API clarity, renamed and changed usage of some parameters in
    soxr_quality_spec_t (ABI compatible, API incompatible). An application not
    setting these parameters directly need make no change; otherwise, changes
    should be made per the following example. (As shown, compatibility with both
    old/new APIs is maintained.)

    #if !defined SOXR_VERSION /* Deprecated, 0.1.0 API */
      q_spec.phase = minimum_phase? 0 : 50;
      q_spec.bw_pc = cutoff * 100;
      q_spec.anti_aliasing_pc = anti_aliasing * 100;
    #else /* 0.1.1 API */                                  Explanation:
      q_spec.phase_response = minimum_phase? 0 : 50;       Renamed.
      q_spec.passband_end = cutoff;                        Renamed, no longer %.
      q_spec.stopband_begin = 2 - anti_aliasing;           Renamed, no longer %,
    #endif                                                 now mirrored in Fs.

    See also the comments on these parameters in soxr.h.  N.B. ABI compatibility
    with the 0.1.0 API may be removed in a future release.
